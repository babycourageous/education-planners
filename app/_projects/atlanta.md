In January 2009, Education Planners conducted a maintenance assessment for the district’s 94 schools. The scope of the project involved site visits and interviews, and included:

- Evaluating the reasonableness of program costs relative to results
- Assessing the relationship between staffing and other costs and measurable program benefits
- Reviewing the adequacy of management’s system for measuring success
- Assessing the extent to which desired levels of results are achieved
- Identifying risk factors that inhibit satisfactory performance
